# uBlockVanced 0.3.2

Release tooling and packaging update; no runtime changes to the extension.

- **Every browser packaged**: `make packages` now emits chromium.zip, a signed chromium.crx, firefox.xpi, opera.zip, and thunderbird.xpi from a single `dist/version`, named `uBlockVanced-<version>.<browser>.<ext>`.
- **Automatic releases**: pushing a new `dist/version` to `main` builds all packages, tags the commit, and publishes the GitHub release. Tags are no longer pushed by hand.
- **Stable extension ID**: the CRX signing key is documented and stored outside git (`uBlockVanced.pem`, `.env`, and the `CRX_PRIVATE_KEY` repo secret) so the Chromium extension ID stays `ongbahmlaoecaggpjgeojpgahgeojnmo` across releases.
- **AGENTS.md**: added a codebase overview and contribution rules for AI coding agents.

# uBlockVanced 0.3.1

Roadmap drain release: filter-list change visibility, resilient logger resizing, and the completed Element Probe and filtering improvements below.

**New features:**
- **Per-site user filters**: My filters now supports a persistent hostname list that disables all custom network, cosmetic, scriptlet, HTML, and response-header filters for a site and its subdomains without changing subscribed lists.
- **Stale cosmetic filter cleanup**: Declarative user cosmetic filters are observed on active pages and commented out after 30 consecutive days without a matching element; procedural filters are left unchanged.
- **Cross-engine cosmetic imports**: My filters now recognizes AdGuard, ABP, and uBlock Origin Lite cosmetic separators, normalizes compatible procedural aliases, and inserts review notes for syntax that may not compile in uBO.
- **CSP-compatible cosmetic mode**: Advanced Settings can route cosmetic styles through constructable stylesheets on strict-CSP sites, falling back to the extension stylesheet API when the browser does not support them.
- **Element Probe modularization**: The DevTools panel is now split into focused state/UI, inspection, history, picker, and frame modules; behavior remains coordinated by a small entry point.
- **Filter list update diffs**: Subscribed lists now retain a compact previous-update diff, with an inline dashboard link showing added, removed, and modified rules.
- **Resizable logger columns**: Filter, initiator, and URL columns can be resized with pointer dragging; normalized widths persist across logger sessions.
- **Searchable filter history**: Filter History section in Element Probe now has a search input. Live-filters displayed entries by filter text with count badge showing "N of M filters" during search.
- **Catppuccin palette swapping**: All four Catppuccin palettes are now supported — Mocha (default), Frappe, Macchiato, and Latte. Set via Advanced Settings: `catppuccinPalette` to `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`, or `catppuccin-latte`. All dark theme structural tokens, logger colors, syntax highlighting, popup rule colors, and scrollbar tokens are derived from palette-level CSS variables (`--ctp-*`) that swap cleanly between variants.

**Build fix:**
- **Common asset copy**: Removed the stale `src/icons` copy step after the icon set moved to `src/img`; clean Chromium builds no longer fail on the missing directory.

**Audit fixes (v0.3.0 hardening pass 2):**
- **P1**: Picker timer-freezing now replays frozen callbacks on cleanup — no more permanently broken page timers. Capped at 500 entries with beforeunload safety net.
- **P1**: User filter writes (append/remove) serialized through a mutex — concurrent writes no longer silently overwrite each other.
- **P2**: Selector list click targeting scoped to correct list — mixed CSS/procedural selector indices no longer mismatch.
- **P2**: History panel renders all entries (was capped at 20 of 50). Count badge now matches visible list.
- **P2**: Context menu probe no longer injects page-visible `window.__ubp_*` properties. Dead `inspect()` call removed. Attribute marker shortened.
- **P2**: Dead domain checker tooltip warns about IP exposure to checked domains.
- **P3**: GPC setting toggleable without extension restart — listener always registered, checks setting on each request.
- **P3**: Scrollbar tokens added to `@media prefers-color-scheme` blocks — invisible scrollbars fixed for system-theme users.
- **P3**: Attribute names now escaped with CSS.escape() before selector interpolation — prevents injection via crafted attribute names.

**Audit fixes (v0.3.0 hardening pass 1):**
- **Critical**: Exception filters (`#@#`) can now be applied, previewed, and tested — regex only matched `##` before, silently rejecting all exception rules.
- **Critical**: Filter collision detection now works — `getUserRules` message handler was missing so the feature silently did nothing.
- **Critical**: `forced-color-adjust: none` removed from `:root` — was breaking Windows High Contrast mode for the entire extension.
- **Security**: `:has-text()` filter text now escapes parentheses — attacker-controlled page text could break out of filter syntax.
- **Security**: `cosmeticHideStyle` hidden setting now validates against dangerous CSS patterns (url(), @import, expression(), braces).
- **Security**: GPC header deduplication — avoids duplicate `Sec-GPC` headers.
- **Security**: Dead domain checker capped at 100 domains with AbortController cancellation.
- **Reliability**: Highlight overlay creation capped at 200 elements — broad selectors no longer freeze pages.
- **Reliability**: Shadow DOM scan bounded to 10K nodes — prevents hangs on massive DOMs.
- **Reliability**: `reapplyFilter` only marks history entry active on successful persist — was desynchronizing state.
- **Accessibility**: Focus ring restored for `[role="button"]` elements, popup/dashboard blanket `:focus { outline: 0 }` changed to `:focus:not(:focus-visible)`.
- **Accessibility**: Fixed 3 undefined CSS variables in Element Probe panel (`--text-secondary` → `--text-dim`, `--accent-warn` → `--accent-peach`).
- **Code quality**: Removed duplicate `:matches-path()` generation, dead `universal` array, dead `totalFlex` variable, dead `probeClassPatterns` hidden setting. Synced classifyClasses test with actual implementation.


- **Element Probe**: `:style()` procedural operator with inline CSS input field. `:matches-path()` filter generation (exact path + directory patterns). `:matches-prop()` generation with React `__reactProps$` scanning and generic JS property inspection. `:matches-css-before()`/`:matches-css-after()` for pseudo-element computed styles. `:matches-media()` for viewport-conditional filters with mobile breakpoint preset.
- **Filter authoring**: Editable domain input field with auto-strip `www.` prefix (top upstream request #1277). Multi-domain filter scoping (`domain1,domain2##`). Filter collision detection — warns on duplicate, superset, subset, or conflicting rules before saving.
- **Accessibility**: `forced-colors` media query support across 5 CSS files — outline-based focus rings, system color fallbacks, border replacements for box-shadow under Windows High Contrast mode.
- **Privacy**: Global Privacy Control (`Sec-GPC: 1`) header via `gpcEnabled` hidden setting.
- **Infrastructure**: CI now runs 35 unit tests on every push/PR alongside lint. Makefile publish targets fixed (gorhill → SysAdminDoc).
- **Element Probe internals**: Configurable class name classifier patterns (externalized from hardcoded regexes to `probeClassPatterns` storage key). `buildInspectScript()` function replaces static `INSPECT_SCRIPT` const for dynamic pattern injection.
- **Dead domain detection**: "Check domains" button in My Filters page. Tests each domain via HEAD request and highlights rules targeting unresolvable domains.
- **i18n**: Element Probe panel internationalized — 65+ message keys added, lightweight `renderI18n()` renderer for DevTools panel context, all HTML static text uses `data-i18n` attributes.
- **Modularization**: Element Probe split into ES modules — page-context scripts (1149 lines) extracted to `src/js/element-probe/page-scripts.js`. New operators can now be added by editing only the scripts module.
- **YouTube sweep**: One-shot scan of 27 known YouTube ad container selectors (in-feed ads, overlays, companion banners, shorts, live chat, super chats, etc.) with visibility reporting. Auto-shows on YouTube pages.
- **JSON export**: Export user filters as structured JSON with per-rule type classification (cosmetic/exception/network), domain parsing, metadata, and leading `!` comments preserved as per-rule notes.

----------

# uBlockVanced 0.2.6

Reliability hardening across dashboards, build tooling, and the Element Probe save path.

- **document-blocked**: `JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(details=…))` now wrapped in try/catch. A malformed or truncated query string no longer prevents the blocked-document UI from rendering.
- **Startup race protection**: `popup-fenix.js`, `theme.js`, `settings.js`, `cloud-ui.js` all add a rejection handler on their initial `.then(...)` startup messages. A slow-to-wake background worker no longer leaves the popup / dashboard / cloud widget stuck in "loading".
- **cloud-ui**: XHR that fetches the cloud widget template now has `onerror` / `ontimeout` handlers and checks HTTP status before parsing — an interrupted update or corrupted install won't crash the hosting dashboard page.
- **settings**: `onUserSettingsReceived` / `onLocalDataReceived` guard `result instanceof Object` before iterating; a null result no longer throws on the first setting it touches.
- **Element Probe selector preflight**: new `isValidCssSelector` check (via `document.createDocumentFragment().querySelector`) rejects invalid standard CSS before it reaches the user filter list. Users see an actionable error instead of a silently-ignored rule. Procedural filters (`:has-text`, `:upward`, `:matches-path`) skip the preflight by design.
- **Build scripts**: `tools/make-chromium.sh` and `tools/make-firefox.sh` rewritten with `set -euo pipefail`, fully-quoted variables, and safer `${1:-}` expansion. Prevents silent failures when the build runs in a path with spaces, and ensures any single command failure aborts the build instead of cascading into a corrupt package.
- **Meta generator**: `tools/make-chromium-meta.py` dev-build name injection now tolerates variants that omit `browser_action` or `action` (MV3 vs MV2 drift). Previously threw `KeyError`.
- **Release template**: `.github/workflows/RELEASE.HEAD.md` rewritten for fork identity — links and install instructions now point to `SysAdminDoc/uBlockVanced` with clear notes about unsigned dev-build installation on Chromium and Firefox.

----------

# uBlockVanced 0.2.5

Correctness and reliability pass focused on the fork-specific custom code paths (Element Probe, context menu integration, user-filter messaging).

- **Race fix — createUserFilter**: `messaging.js` `createUserFilter` now awaits `µb.createUserFilters` before invoking the response callback; `µb.createUserFilters` is now `async` and awaits `appendUserFilters`. Previously the callback fired *before* the filter was written, so a client that immediately reloaded the page (as the Element Probe flow does implicitly) could hit a race where the page loaded without the new rule.
- **Race fix — context menu iframe targeting**: `ensureProbeListener` now injects into every frame (`allFrames: true`) with a top-frame fallback. Previously the listener was installed only in the top frame, so a right-click inside an iframe never marked `[data-ubp-ctx-target]`; the DevTools handler then fell back to the top-frame `<body>`, inspecting the wrong element.
- **Panel-closed safety**: Element Probe panel sets a `panelClosed` flag on `pagehide`/`unload`. Every async callback (devtools `eval`, `sendMessage`, `storage.local`, clipboard, setTimeout) checks the flag before touching DOM, so late-resolving work no longer crashes against a detached document.
- **Null safety in setStatus / setText / display helpers**: every `document.getElementById(...)` result is null-guarded. Prevents hard crash if the DevTools host delays panel DOM construction.
- **Robust payload parsing**: `inspectSelected` wraps `JSON.parse` in its own try/catch and normalises missing `selectors`, `proceduralFilters`, `classes`, `attrs` — partial/older payloads render as best-effort instead of throwing.
- **Idempotent navigation listener**: `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.onNavigated` is guarded by `window.__elementProbe_navListenerInstalled__`; panel recreation no longer stacks duplicate handlers.
- **Debounced selection inspector**: `onSelectionChanged` debounced at 120 ms. Arrow-key scrolling through the Elements tree no longer piles up in-flight `evalInPage` calls that resolve against stale state.
- **History deduplication no longer loses entries on failed save**: `addToHistory` updates the existing entry in place (selector / timestamp / active) before re-unshifting it; old code did `filter(…) + unshift(…)` which could drop the old record if the follow-up `saveHistory` or `persistFilter` failed mid-stream. `length = MAX_HISTORY` truncation avoids a fresh array allocation.
- **persistFilter now awaitable**: returns a `Promise<boolean>`; both the Save button flow and `reapplyFilter` await the round-trip, so the `active` flag in history only flips true after the storage write actually completed.
- **undoFilter rewrite**: new `sendMessageAsync` / `unhideOnPage` helpers replace the nested-promise-inside-callback pattern. `removeUserFilter` errors now surface cleanly, the page fallback runs deterministically, and `chrome.runtime.lastError` is consumed before logging.
- **Explicit `type="button"` on all `<button>`s in `element-probe-panel.html`** — prevents accidental form submission behaviour and clarifies intent.

----------

# uBlockVanced 0.2.4

- Accessibility: added `lang="en"` to every HTML document across `src/` (including web_accessible_resources: epicker-ui, click2load, dom-inspector, noop). Screen readers previously announced pages with no language declaration.
- Fixed malformed viewport meta in `document-blocked.html` (`initial-scale=1 user-scalable=yes` → comma-separated list).
- Resolved 3 outstanding `/* TODO: fix */` color tokens — `--popup-cell-label-mixed-surface` now uses Catppuccin Yellow in dark mode, Catppuccin Yellow-60 in light, and a colorblind-safe amber in the colorblind palette.
- CSS system consolidation: extracted shared `.editorHero`, `.editorEyebrow`, `.editorTitle`, `.editorLead`, `.editorStatus`, `.statusPill.*` (incl. new `is-danger` variant) from `1p-filters.css`, `whitelist.css`, and `advanced-settings.css` into `dashboard-common.css`. ~180 lines of duplicate CSS removed; single source of truth for editor-page hero / status pill styling.
- Tokenization: `cloud-ui.css` `#cloudInfo` / `#cloudError` now use `--field-surface` / `--danger-surface`; `advanced-settings.css` `.advancedGuideLink` uses `--warning-surface` / `--warning-border`.
- `.fa-icon.info` (dashboard-common) gains a transition and focus-visible state; removed dead `transform: scale(1.25)` rule that was silently overridden by the newer `translateY(-1px)` hover.
- About page: decorative icon marked `aria-hidden="true"` (explicit semantic intent).
- Element Probe panel document now has `viewport`, `color-scheme`, and a polished `<title>`.
- Package metadata updated for fork identity: `name`, `version`, `description`, `repository.url`, `author`, `bugs.url`, `homepage`, and SPDX-compliant `GPL-3.0` license identifier (was non-standard `GPLv3`).

----------

# uBlockVanced 0.2.3

- Premium polish: unified scrollbar styling via shared `--scrollbar-*` tokens in `common.css` (removes duplicated dark-mode-only rules from `dashboard.css` and `popup-fenix.css`); lighter, token-driven thumb with smooth hover transition.
- Tokenized popup dark-polish block: replaced raw Catppuccin `rgb(...)` values in `#sticky`, `#switch`, `#hostname`, `#basicStats`, and `#unprocessedRequestWarning` with `--surface-raised*`, `--warning-surface/border`, `--danger-surface/border`, `--red-40`, and `--ink-rgb`. Removed redundant premium-polish rules superseded by later declarations.
- Fixed non-existent `--secondary-60` token reference in `#basicStats .statCard::after` gradient — now uses `--violet-40` and animates fill transitions.
- Settings `#reset`: now uses `--danger-surface` / `--danger-border` with a proper hover state instead of hardcoded red rgb.
- 3p-filters: normalized focus ring to `box-shadow: var(--focus-ring)` (dropped bespoke 2px outline); added transitions to `.fa-icon` and `.nodestats`; refined spinner timing (`cubic-bezier` easing, 1.1s).
- Support page: same spinner timing refinement; tidied `@keyframes spin` shorthand.
- Logger: `#filterButton` starts at 0.45 opacity with hover/focus-visible reveal + smooth transition (was an abrupt 0.25 ↔ 1 flip).
- Dashboard: removed stale keyboard-nav TODO block left over from upstream.
- Added `.statusPill.is-danger` and `.statusPill.is-accent` variants to `whitelist.css` for parity with `1p-filters.css`.
- Element Probe scrollbar: aligned with shared token style (transparent track, padded thumb, rounded 999px).

# 1.54.0

## New

Differential update of filter lists, as a result of discussions at <https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/issues/192>. Resulting spec is [here](https://github.com/ameshkov/diffupdates).

![inkscape](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/assets/585534/3ee3567b-e24f-4d39-90e2-915b39a114fb)

The goal is to **NOT** be ranked among the "most popular projects" by bandwidth usage (as per [jsDelivr's public stats](https://www.jsdelivr.com/statistics)):

![jsDelivr stats](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/assets/585534/96c7e0fa-ffcc-4879-a01e-e340b4f0fa9e)

It is expected that differential updates will lower both requests and bandwidth usage.

To benefit the much shorter update period enabled by differential updates, you must let uBO auto-update the filter lists. Forcing a manual update will prevent differential updates until the next time a list auto-update.

## Roadmap archive — 2026-08-10 — ROADMAP.md

<details>
<summary>Original roadmap snapshot</summary>

```markdown
# ROADMAP

uBlockForge (v0.3.0, branded "uBlockVanced" in-repo) is an MV2 uBlock Origin fork with a DevTools panel ("Element Probe") for deep element inspection, procedural cosmetic filter generation, Catppuccin Mocha theme, and YouTube-specific selector tooling.

## Planned Features

### Element Probe

### Filter management
- Filter history with one-click undo (already exists) expanded to a searchable filter-log panel
- Export user filters as a shareable JSON with per-rule notes
- Per-site enable/disable of user filters
- Auto-disable filters that match zero elements for 30 days (stale filter cleanup)
- Import from AdGuard / ABP / uBlock-Origin-Lite cosmetic syntax with a compatibility note for procedurals that can't cross over

### Theme
- Theme palette object (Catppuccin Latte/Frappe/Macchiato/Mocha swappable)

### Safety
- CSP-compatible mode for sites that reject inline-injected filters

## Competitive Research

- **uBlock Origin (upstream)** — The ground truth. uBO has the smartest dev team in the space; don't out-feature, differentiate on tooling
- **uBlock Origin Lite (MV3)** — The official MV3 successor; uBlockForge needs a story for when MV2 sunsets in Chrome stable
- **AdGuard DevTools Assistant** — Commercial DevTools panel for ad-blocker rule authoring; direct competitor to Element Probe
- **Cosmetic Filters Toolkit (uBO wiki)** — Community docs; pull their examples into the Element Probe help pane

## Nice-to-Haves

- Built-in recorder that captures page interaction and suggests filters for elements that appear mid-flow (infinite-scroll injections)
- Side-panel diff when a site's DOM changes (before/after markup) to speed up filter repair after site redesigns
- YouTube-specific "sweep" mode that one-shots the current known ad container set and reports which are present
- Shareable permalinks to a specific filter draft for collaborative filter authoring

## Open-Source Research (Round 2)

### Related OSS Projects
- https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock — upstream uBlock Origin (MV2 reference implementation, procedural engine source of truth)
- https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues — canonical issue tracker + procedural filter wiki
- https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters — AdGuard filter repo, syntax divergences worth tracking (`{ remove: true; }`, `$$`)
- https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension — reference MV2+MV3 dual-manifest build pipeline
- https://github.com/ghostery/adblocker — TypeScript adblocker engine with a published compatibility matrix
- https://github.com/ghostery/adblocker/wiki/Compatibility-Matrix — ground-truth operator support across uBO/ABP/AdGuard/Brave
- https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters — Nano-specific snippet filters, ideas for `+js(...)` scriptlets
- https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust — Rust adblock engine (useful for perf/AST ideas even if not directly portable)
- https://gist.github.com/unixzii/37369baa7996cdc8dd459c267785603b — fuck-x userscript with aggressive X/Twitter element rules to stress-test Element Probe
- https://github.com/hoblin/x-ad-banhammer — advertiser-auto-block userscript, interesting complement filter flow

### Features to Borrow
- Scriptlet injection (`+js(...)`) pipeline for page-world patches, with a vetted scriptlet library — NanoFilters + uBO scriptlets folder
- Depth/specificity dual-slider in the generated-filter modal — uBO element picker UI
- Hostname auto-prefix guard (discard generic procedural filters at parse time) — uBO engine invariant

### Patterns & Architectures Worth Studying
- Static filter AST → compiled procedural pipeline in uBO's `cosmeticFilteringEngine.js` (build once, run many)
- Shadow DOM piercing strategy: uBO's late-injected content script walks open shadow roots via `element.shadowRoot` recursion with a WeakSet to avoid infinite loops — port to Element Probe for YouTube chat banner selection
- `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval()` + `useContentScriptContext: true` split between DevTools page and target tab — already used; cross-check against AdGuard DevTools assistant for idle-connection handling
- Procedural filter quote-escaping rules (`\'`, `\"`, `\`) — must match uBO exactly or filter imports will silently drift
- Test-runner pattern from `ghostery/adblocker`: snapshot-based filter-output tests against real-world HTML fixtures — adopt for regression coverage as operator set grows

## Implementation Deep Dive (Round 3)

### Reference Implementations to Study
- **gorhill/uBlock / src/js/static-net-filtering.js** — https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock — the static-filter compiler; reference for converting ABP-syntax filters into a trie + bitmap lookup structure.
- **uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home** — https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home — the MV3 fork; authoritative example of compiling ABP syntax to declarativeNetRequest rulesets at build time (not runtime).
- **gorhill/uBlock commit a559f5f ("Add experimental mv3 version")** — https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commit/a559f5f2715c58fea4de09330cf3d06194ccc897 — first MV3 attempt ("uBO Minus"); documents what couldn't be ported (no `##`, no `##+js`, no `redirect=`, no `csp=`, no `removeparam=`).
- **DeepWiki: uBOL MV3 architecture** — https://deepwiki.com/gorhill/uBlock/8-ublock-origin-lite-(mv3) — layered permissions model (basic/optimal/complete) mapped to `<all_urls>` vs. `activeTab` vs. per-site; directly applicable to our UX.
- **gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax** — https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax — ABP syntax + uBO extensions; authoritative.
- **AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension** — https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension — alternative MV3 implementation; compare their DNR rule generator to uBOL's for ideas.
- **EasyList / EasyPrivacy / Peter Lowe's** — https://easylist.to — default ruleset sources; our build pipeline must fetch, diff, and recompile on list updates.

### Known Pitfalls from Similar Projects
- **30K dynamic rule cap** (Chrome's DNR limit per extension; 330K across all extensions) — uBOL pre-compiles into static rulesets (bigger, free), and reserves dynamic slots for per-user custom filters. Plan: 3-4 static rulesets by filter-list category, dynamic slots for user rules only. Ref: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)
- **No cosmetic filtering via DNR** — `##` hiding requires content scripts injected via `chrome.scripting`; uBOL ships a separate cosmetic filter compiler. Can't ship one or the other — need both.
- **No live filter-list updates without extension update** — the MV3 model requires new list content to ship as a new extension version. Set expectation in README or implement as `dynamic_rules` with quotas.
- **Firefox DNR is slow** — Firefox's implementation is JS-based and un-optimized (bugzilla 1745768); ship MV2 blocking-webRequest for Firefox as long as they permit it.
- **`removeparam=` / `csp=` / `redirect=` not fully supported in MV3** — `removeparam` now via DNR `queryTransform`; `csp` via `modifyHeaders` action; `redirect` only for extension-bundled resources. Ref: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax
- **`urlskip=`** trusted-source only under MV3 — can't be enabled from untrusted user lists. Document as a limitation.
- **"Browser-launch filtering"** — MV3 actually wins here for static rules; they apply before our SW starts. Make this visible in the popup so users understand the tradeoff.

### Library Integration Checklist
- **chrome.declarativeNetRequest** MV3; entrypoint `chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateEnabledRulesets` / `updateDynamicRules`; gotcha: static rulesets counted against 330K cap; 5K dynamic cap; 30K per-extension (Chrome 120+ raised this).
- **chrome.scripting.executeScript** (cosmetic filtering); entrypoint `world:"ISOLATED"`; gotcha: need `host_permissions` or `activeTab`; bulk `registerContentScripts` for static cosmetic rules.
- **abp-filter-parser / @adblockplus/adblockpluscore** — pin latest; entrypoint build-time filter compiler; gotcha: not all uBO-extended syntax supported — layer a custom compiler on top.
- **esbuild** `>=0.25`; entrypoint `esbuild.build`; gotcha: ruleset JSON generation is a separate build step, not a bundler concern.
- **Node 20+ build script** — entrypoint `node scripts/compile-lists.mjs`; gotcha: must be deterministic (sort rules by id) so CI diffs are readable.
- **chrome.storage.local** for user custom filters; gotcha: 10MB quota, declare `unlimitedStorage` if we allow large custom lists.
- **ajv** pin `>=8.x` (ruleset schema validation); gotcha: uBOL's schema differs from Chrome's documented schema in a few fields — validate against Chrome's, not uBOL's.

## Research-Driven Additions

### P2 — Medium (quality, testing, DX improvements)

- [ ] P2 — Element Probe panel i18n
  Why: 72 locale directories exist with translations for all uBO UI, but Element Probe panel text is hardcoded English in HTML and JS. Only the context menu entry ("Inspect with Element Probe") uses i18n.
  Evidence: `src/_locales/en/messages.json` — only `contextMenuElementProbe` string for Element Probe. All panel text (`src/element-probe-panel.html`, `src/js/element-probe-panel.js`) is hardcoded.
  Touches: `src/_locales/en/messages.json` (new keys), `src/element-probe-panel.html` (mustache placeholders), `src/js/element-probe-panel.js` (status/log messages)
  Acceptance: Element Probe panel renders correctly in at least 3 non-English locales. All user-visible strings use i18n keys.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P2 — Modularize `element-probe-panel.js`
  Why: 1822-line single IIFE containing all panel logic — inspection, UI rendering, event handling, history, picker, frame targeting. Adding new procedural operators or features requires modifying a monolithic file.
  Evidence: `wc -l src/js/element-probe-panel.js` = 1822 lines.
  Touches: `src/js/element-probe-panel.js` → split into `src/js/element-probe/inspect.js`, `src/js/element-probe/ui.js`, `src/js/element-probe/history.js`, `src/js/element-probe/picker.js`, `src/js/element-probe/frames.js`
  Acceptance: Panel behavior is identical; each module is <400 lines; new operators can be added by editing only `inspect.js`.
  Complexity: L


- [ ] P2 — Filter list update diff view in dashboard
  Why: When subscribed filter lists update, users can't see what changed. Debugging breakage from list updates is trial-and-error. This is distinct from the existing "Side-panel diff" nice-to-have (which is about site DOM changes).
  Evidence: Community research — filter list management pain point. No diff UI exists in uBO or any competitor.
  Touches: `src/js/3p-filters.js`, `src/3p-filters.html`, `src/css/3p-filters.css`
  Acceptance: After a filter list updates, a "View changes" link shows added/removed/modified rules since the previous version.
  Complexity: L



- [ ] P2 — Resizable logger columns
  Why: Upstream declined this request (uBlock-issues #853, 4 thumbs-up). Logger columns are fixed-width, making it hard to read long URLs or filter expressions. A differentiator the fork can implement that upstream won't.
  Evidence: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/853 — declined by gorhill.
  Touches: `src/js/logger-ui.js`, `src/css/logger-ui.css`
  Acceptance: Logger columns are draggable-resizable. Column widths persist across sessions via `chrome.storage.local`.
  Complexity: M

### P3 — Low (nice-to-have, future differentiation)

- [ ] P3 — Cookie consent auto-dismiss integration
  Why: Ghostery's Never-Consent and Brave's built-in consent handling auto-reject cookie banners. This is increasingly expected by privacy-focused users. The `@duckduckgo/autoconsent` library (MIT-licensed, 116 stars) provides ready-made rules for navigating consent popups.
  Evidence: Ghostery v10.5.40+ uses `@duckduckgo/autoconsent` v14.97.0. uBO has annoyance filter lists but no auto-dismiss logic.
  Touches: New content script integrating autoconsent library, settings toggle, `src/js/settings.js`
  Acceptance: Cookie consent banners are automatically dismissed (opt-out) on supported sites. User can enable/disable in settings.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P3 — `content-visibility: hidden` as performance-optimized cosmetic hiding
  Why: `content-visibility: hidden` skips rendering (layout + paint) for hidden elements, potentially faster than `display: none !important` for pages with many cosmetic filter matches. Elements remain in DOM for JavaScript access but browsers skip expensive rendering work.
  Evidence: MDN `content-visibility` — Baseline since September 2024. Brave's cosmetic filtering uses two-phase approach (URL-specific at load, generic on discovery) suggesting performance matters at scale.
  Touches: `src/js/cosmetic-filtering.js`, `src/js/contentscript-extra.js`
  Acceptance: Option to use `content-visibility: hidden` instead of `display: none` for cosmetic filters. Measurable rendering performance improvement on heavy pages (100+ cosmetic matches).
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P3 — "Distractions" toggle UI for annoyance categories
  Why: Ghostery v10.5.44 introduced "Distractions" — toggle-based hiding for YouTube Shorts, Instagram/Facebook Reels, social share widgets, Google Sign-In popups. uBO has annoyance filter lists but no dedicated toggle UI. A category-based toggle is more discoverable than subscribing to filter lists.
  Evidence: Ghostery release notes v10.5.44. uBO ships EasyList Cookie, uBO Annoyances, AdGuard Annoyances as subscribable lists.
  Touches: `src/js/popup-fenix.js`, `src/popup-fenix.html`, `src/css/popup-fenix.css` (toggle section), `src/js/messaging.js` (list subscription management)
  Acceptance: Popup has toggles for annoyance categories (cookie banners, social widgets, newsletter popups, video autoplay). Each toggle subscribes/unsubscribes the corresponding filter list.
  Complexity: L
